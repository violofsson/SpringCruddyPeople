## Description
A fairly simple CRUD app used for interacting with a database of personal
information. Includes two UIs: a Thymeleaf-based web interface and a rich REST
API. Also includes default (fictional) data for some familiar names.

This repository was uploaded after grading had finished, and has since been polished a bit for richer REST resources.
